Abstract:

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a format for representing data.  In this thesis we show how to capture the history of changes to a JSON document.  Capturing the history is  important  in  many  applications,  where  not  only  the  current  version  of  a  document  is required,  but all the previous versions.  Conceptually the history can be thought of as a  sequence of non-temporal JSON documents, one for each instant of time.  Each document in the sequence is called a snapshot.  Since changes to a document are few and infrequent, the sequence of snapshots largely duplicates a document across many time instants, so the snapshot  model  is  (wildly)  inefficient  in  terms  of  space  needed  to  represent  the  history and time taken to navigate within it.  A more efficient representation can be achieved by “gluing” the snapshots together to form a temporal model.  Data that remains unchanged across  snapshots  is  represented  only  once  in  a  temporal  model.   But  we  show  that  the temporal  model  is  not  a  JSON  document,  and  it  is  important  to  represent  a  history  as JSON to ensure compatibility with web services and scripting languages that use JSON. Sowe describe a representational model that captures the information in a temporal model.  We implement the representational model in Python and extensively experiment with the model.  Our experiments show that the model is efficient.
