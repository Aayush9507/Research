JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a format for representing data.  In this thesis weshow how to capture the history of changes to a JSON document.  Capturing the historyis  important  in  many  applications,  where  not  only  the  current  version  of  a  document  isrequired,  but all the previous versions.  Conceptually the history can be thought of as asequence of non-temporal JSON documents, one for each instant of time.  Each documentin the sequence is called a snapshot.  Since changes to a document are few and infrequent,the sequence of snapshots largely duplicates a document across many time instants, so thesnapshot  model  is  (wildly)  inefficient  in  terms  of  space  needed  to  represent  the  historyand time taken to navigate within it.  A more efficient representation can be achieved by“gluing” the snapshots together to form a temporal model.  Data that remains unchangedacross  snapshots  is  represented  only  once  in  a  temporal  model.   But  we  show  that  thetemporal  model  is  not  a  JSON  document,  and  it  is  important  to  represent  a  history  asJSON to ensure compatibility with web services and scripting languages that use JSON. Sowe describe a representational model that captures the information in a temporal model.We implement the representational model in Python and extensively experiment with themodel.  Our experiments show that the model is efficient.
